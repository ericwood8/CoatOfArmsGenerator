# CoatOfArmsGenerator
Coat Of Arms Generator (C#, written in .NET 5)

Designed to be a flexible creator of coat-of-arms. The program randomly picks a shield shape, how to divide the shield (if any) (called divisions or ordinaries), and symbol (if any) (called charges).  Also, it randomly chooses a color from a palete of true heraldric colors for each piece being careful about not overlaying black on black for example. To add new symbol designs or ordinaries or shield shapes, just add a new file in the subdirectories provided.  Just ensure it follows the rules about the picture (for example on symbols, paint any changeable portions black).
